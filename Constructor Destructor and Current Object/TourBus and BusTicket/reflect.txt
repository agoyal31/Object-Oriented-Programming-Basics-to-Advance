WORKSHOP 4 REFLECTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This workshop was full of knowledge and cleared my alot of concepts that are related to class objects, constructors and destructors. The main challenging part of the 
workshop was how to access the other(child - TourTicket) class member functions inside the parent(TourBus) class. In this workshop, two classes are
there TourBus and TourTicket that acts like parent-child relationship. To begin with, there was TourBus that comes in three sizes based upon the number of passengers 
they can carry inside them that marks whether the tour bus is valid or not. If the number of passengers carried by them is from 4,16 or 22 then the 
tour bus is valid otherwise it is not. Moreover, if we look at the file main.cpp, the dynamic allocation of class TourBus object is taking place that is taking one 
argument num(noOfPassengers). Here, an object of class TourBus is made that is accepting an argument(num) is created. Because, the new object is made,
with one argument, therefore one argument constructor is called immediately. If the number of passengers entered is equal to 4 then the boarding of passengers will 
take place in other two cases(16 or 22) it will display that the "Cannot start the tour, the bus is not fully boarded!". Now as soon as boarding of 
passengers start, it will ask for the names of four passengers who are waiting for boarding. During boarding we have to insert and extract on terminal the name of 
passengers. So, I have to make an array that can hold a name of passenger in the class TourBus. But as per instructions I am restricted to do that but
I have the class TourTicket in which the name of different passengers are first inserted and then extacted dynamically. To, access member functions of that class
(that are performing the task of assigning(issue) and displaying(display)), I have to first make the object of TourTicket class in TourBus class that is 
pointing dynamically to TourTicket Class. Since, I want to insert that many names of passengers that a bus will carry(based upon the constructor of the TourBus). 
So, I have to dynamically allocate the memory for the creation of objects that will be holding the names of passangers that a bus is carrying(that are 4 in this case).
Hence, array of four objects of class TourTicket is made inside the class TourBus.
                                                     ticketObj = new TourTicket[m_CarryPassangers]
After the objects are made, now it can access the member functions of class TourTicket and can insert the names of passengers by accessing the issue member function
 of TourTicket class by its object over and over again(loop) till all the passengers are not boarded as per the specified format.
At last, function startTheTour is called, if the tour is valid(if (validTour()) and boarding is done(done == true) then the boarded passengers and their ticket 
numbers will be dsplayed in the specified format otherwise if ((validTour() && done == false)) then the message will be printed as displayed above.
