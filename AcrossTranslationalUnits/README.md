LEARNING OUTCOMES:

1) receive program arguments from the command line
2) guard a class definition from duplication in a translation unit (#ifndef, #define)
3) access a variable defined in a different translation unit (EXTERN KEYWORD)
4) declare a local variable that resides in memory throughout the lifetime of the program (STATIC KEYWORD)
5) upgrade code to accept and manage a user-defined string of any length
